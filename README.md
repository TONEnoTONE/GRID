# GRID
it's cool. 

## Compiling

Let's closure this thing!

comments must look like this for closure:
```
/** comment */
```
or multiline
```
/**
	comment
*/
```

[closure compiler tags](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler#tags)

to compile the required code use [r.js](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js)
